### Patch 0003 - AIDA Core Scaffold v2

This patch introduces the foundational scaffold for the AIDA core assistant module. The AIDA module will underpin the UltraSonIQ platform's AI capabilities and provide integration into context-aware automation, remediation support, and knowledge assistance.

**Key Features:**
- Modular design of the AI assistant core
- Basic intent recognition and routing system scaffold
- Context management interface
- Logging and diagnostics
- Associated test files and initial documentation

This is a production-ready scaffolding and is not a stub. Code is functional and extendable.
